First, give you an initial array arr. Then, every day you need to generate a new array based on the previous day's array.

First 'i' The array generated by the day is determined by your 'i-1' . The array of days is obtained as follows:

If an element is smaller than its left and right neighbors, then the element increments1。
If an element is larger than its left and right neighbors, then the element decrements1。
First and last elementsNeverChange.
After some time, you will find that the array will no longer change, please return to the final array.

 

Example 1:

Enter:[6,2,3,4]
Output:[6,3,3,4]
Explanation:
 On the first day, the array changes from [6,2,3,4] to [6,3,3,4].
 No more operations can be performed on the array.
Example 2:

Enter:[1,6,3,4,3,5]
Output:[1,4,4,4,4,5]
Explanation:
 On the first day, the array changes from [1,6,3,4,3,5] to [1,5,4,3,4,5].
 The next day, the array changed from [1,5,4,3,4,5] to [1,4,4,4,4,5].
 No more operations can be performed on the array.
 

prompt:

1 <= arr.length <= 100
